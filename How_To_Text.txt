Gameplay:

Like many other games in the platforming
genre, "Phil the Candle!" is fundamentally
about traversing a level and collecting
objectives. In this case your primary
objective is to help Phil find all the coins
hidden within each dungeon. This will require
you to traverse the level, by utilizing your
jumping abilities. But beware many other
Candles seek the treasure, and others have
had there flame go out and now stalk the
depths below.

Don't worry too much however, as Phil is
a professional. He has mastered the art of
parkour and is capable of defeating all those
in his path by jumping upon their head. Unlike
other Candles who may only move side to side,
Phil is capable of jumping and wall-jumping.
To perform a wall jump Phil only needs to
jump while interacting with a wall midair.
While Phil may just climb up the same wall
over and over again, jumping between walls
will give Phil a temporary speed boost.

Now that we understand how to make Phil move,
we must understand the environments Phil must
traverse. Every level in Phil the candle is
randomly generated, with each level having
a unique theme, they are jungle, mine, ice,
volcano, and the ancient tomb. These themes
do not add much in terms of difficulty and
may be traversed in any order. For the
seasoned adventuring candle the difficulty
of the level may be increased via the main
menu difficulty slider. This will give Phil
the chance to find more treasure, but treasure
is often protect by a shroud of darkness and
evil.

Have fun, and remember Candles are Cool!
