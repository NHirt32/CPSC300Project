Gameplay:
    Now that you know the basic controls of
the game. Here are some fundamental tricks
to help you play. The Gameplay of
"Phil The Candle!" is akin to other games
in the platforming genre, such as the Mario
series of games produced by Nintendo.
However, unlike the mario series of games
"Phil The Candle!" is a much less linear
experience.

    In this game you play the character Phil.
He is a candle. Phil's goal is to find all
the coins in five randomly generated caverns.
Each of the caverns take a different format,
and can be played in any order. However,
Phil is not alone in these caverns, as monsters
who dislike candles will seek to destroy Phil.
Luckily Phil has the ability to destroy these
enemies by jumping upon their heads.

    To help Phil traverse the depths Phil can
bound off the walls by hitting space on them
midair. This is because Phil is a parkour
expert, which is standard amongst candles.

    The life of a dungeon diving and treasure
seeking candle can be tough, so you have your
choice of three different difficultly levels.
Difficulty 1 allows you to search for only
three coins, difficulty 2 requires you top
search for 5 coins, and difficulty 3 requires
you to search for 8 coins. However, be warned
the more treasure in the dungeon the more
monsters there will be to protect it.

Have fun, and remember Candles are Cool!
